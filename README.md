# Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Example + Template

Two documents are included: 
- A SRS Template (Karl E. Wiegers: https://www.karlwiegers.com/)
- A real example of the usage of this template to derive software design.

The example SRS includes High Level Description, Use Cases, User Roles, Entity Relationship Diagram, UML diagrams describing Specific interactions, UI Mock-ups and recommendations. 

Though this a very old analysis, it may prove useful to others looking to formalize their software design processes.
